# DARTSDisplacements
Apply the nucleus of strain deformation concept (Geertsma et al., 1973), making it is possible to calculate stress and displacements for observations points considering the pressure variation in the reservoir. The methodology considers linear elastic constitutive model and homogenous rock properties (so it is very simplified).  Arelalo et. al. 2020 developed a methodology to solve the integrals proposed by  Mu√±oz and Roehl (2017) for the displacements caused by each nucleus of strain using a scheme according to Nagy et al. (2000), Nagy et al. (2002) and Fukushima (2020), which was first applied to gravimetric problems.  The source code is available on [https://github.com/pinga-lab/DisReserv] and this repository was modified for the purpose of this study.
